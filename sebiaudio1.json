    "Answer": "In a Book Building issue the issuer company mentions the minimum and maximum price (price band) at which it will sell (issue) its shares. Thus the offer document (in this case, called the Red Herring Prospectus) contains only the price band instead of the price at which its shares are offered to the public. Within this price band the investor can choose the price at which the investor are willing to buy the shares and also the quantity. As this process is similar to bidding in an auction, the application form for book built issue is also known as the bid form. At times the issuer may revise the price band (revision of price band) which has to be accompanied with news paper advertisement. Bids by various investors are entered into the stock exchange system through the brokers (also called syndicate member) terminal. The list of the bid received from investors at various price bands is known as the ‘book and can be seen in the website(s) of the stock exchange for each investor category. Based on the total demand in the ‘book, the cut off price is then decided by the issuer and merchant banker. The cut off price is the price at which the cumulative demand for shares, equals or exceeds the offer size. All investors who applied (bid) for shares at or above the cut off price will be allotted shares at the cut off price (issue price), proportionately. If the investment is less than ` 200,000 (retail investor), the investor have the  option of bidding at the cut off price by ticking the cut-off option in the application form.",

    "Answer": "IPO grading is the professional assessment of a Credit Rating Agency (CRAs) on the fundamentals of a company in relation to the other listed equity shares in India. It is mandatory for the issuer company coming with initial public offer (IPO) to obtain IPO grading from a Credit Rating Agency and disclose the same on the cover page of offer document and Application form. IPO grading endeavors to provide the investor with an informed, objective independent and unbiased opinion of a CRA after analyzing various relevant factors. It is an additional input available for your investment decision. An IPO grade is NOT a suggestion or recommendation as to whether an investor should subscribe to the IPO or not. IPO grade needs to be read together with the disclosures made in the offer document including the risk factors as well as the price at which the shares are being offered. IPO grade does not take into account the price of the shares being offered. Therefore, the investors need to make an independent judgment regarding the price of the investment.",

    "Answer": "Each rating symbol is an alphanumeric representation of the degree of repayment risk associated with debt instruments. Depending on the type of debt instrument that is rated (long term, short term or  fixed deposits), rating symbols vary. The debt instruments rated 'BBB' and above are classified as investment grade ratings. An investment grade rating signifies the rating agencys belief that the rated instrument is likely to meet its payment obligations. Instruments that are rated ‘BB‘ and below are classified as speculative grade category ratings in which case the ability to meet the payment obligations is considered to be “speculative”. Instruments rated in the speculative grade are considered to carry materially higher risk and a higher probability of default compared to instruments rated in the investment grade. Within a rating category, “+” and “-” symbols are used to indicate finer distinctions. Illustratively, ratings in a higher rating category such as ‘AA-‘ is stronger than ratings in a lower rating category such as ‘A+‘.",
