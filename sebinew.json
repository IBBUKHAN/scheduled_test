    "Answer": "Please note that in case the shares, if any, are not available for trading on a Stock Exchange, it is due to reasons such as de-listing  suspension. In this case, it will not be possible for investors to trade in these shares through the Stock Exchange. Trading can resume in shares when the company (de-listed) gets its shares listed at an operational Stock Exchange, and also when a suspended company makes itself compliant with the listing norms. Meanwhile, investors will be able to encash the value of such shares by finding willing buyer for the same.  For assistance you may like to be guided by the advice of concerned company  its Registrar and Transfer Agent (RTA).",
