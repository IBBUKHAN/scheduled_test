(2)   Popular  usage  has  expanded  the  meaning  of  the  term  to  include  any  activity  which  attempts  to
buy  a  relatively  underpriced  item  and  sell  a  similar,  relatively  overpriced  item,  expecting  to  profit
when  the  prices  resume  a  more  appropriate  theoretical  or  historical  relationship  (statistical
arbitrage).
(3)    In trading options, convertible securities, and futures, arbitrage techniques can be applied whenever
a strategy involves buying and selling packages of related instruments.
(4)   Risk  arbitrage  applies  the  principles  of  risk  offset  to  mergers  and  other  major  corporate
developments. The risk offsetting position(s) do not insulate the investor from certain event risks
(such  as  termination  of  a  merger  agreement  on  the  risk  of  completion  of  a  transaction  within  a
certain time) so that the arbitrage is incomplete.
(5)   Tax  arbitrage  transactions  are  undertaken  to  share  the  benefit  of  differential  tax  rates  or
circumstances of two or more parties to a transaction.
(6)   Regulatory  arbitrage  transactions  are  designed  to  provide  indirect  access  to  a  risk  management
market where one party is denied direct access by law or regulation.
(7)   Swap  driven  arbitrage  transactions  are  motivated  by  the  comparative  advantages  which  swap
counter-parties  enjoy  in  different  debt  and  currency  markets.  One  counterparty  may  borrow  at  a
relatively  lower  rate  in  the  intermediate  or  long  term  United  States  dollar  market,  while  the  other
may have a comparative advantage in floating rate sterling.

process invariably involves the stripping of another sort of asset (the employees) of a number of jobs.

there  being  a  difference  in  the  price  of  the  business  as  a  whole  (as  valued  by  a  stock  market,  for
example)  and  the  sum  of  the  amounts  that  can  be  raised  from  its  parts  sold  separately.  Such  a

Flip-Over
A  provision  in  a  poison  pill  that  gives  shareholders  the  right  to  buy  the  company’s  shares  (or  the
shares  of  the  surviving  company  after  a  merger)  at  half  price.  Unlike  a  Flip-in,  a  flip-over  right  does
not become effective simply because an interested shareholder buys some stock. Usually it becomes
effective when (i) there is an interested shareholder and (ii) the company engages in certain transactions
with  the  interested  shareholder  or  an  affiliate,  such  as  a  merger  or  a  sale  of  all  or  a  large  part  of  its
assets. Historically, the flip-over poison pill was devised several years before the more powerful flip-in.
At  that  time  the  essential  discrimination  against  the  interested  shareholder  that  the  flip-in  entails  was
widely  considered  illegal.  Now  the  two  are  generally  combined,  although  under  most  circumstances
the flip-in provision of the pill dominates any potential bidder’s attention.
Flip-in poison pill plan
Shareholders are issued rights to acquire stock in the target at a significant discount which is usually
50%.
Flip-in
The  most  important  characteristic  of  the  most  effective  rights  plan  (position  pill)  in  use  today.  It  gives
shareholders the right to buy the company’s shares at half price when someone becomes an ‘interested
shareholder’,  that  is,  crosses  some  stock  ownership  threshold  such  as  15%  or  20%.  The  interested
shareholder’s  rights  are  void.  Other  shareholders  can  (typically)  use  each  of  their  rights  to  buy  a
number  of  shares  equal  to  two  times  the  exercise  price  (set  in  advance),  divided  by  the  current
market price of the target company’s stock. Usually, from the standpoint of a bidder, the flip-in right is
a  complete  show  stopper  unless  the  bidder  can  convince  a  court  that  it  should  intervene.  In  the  text
we have tried to describe when courts intervene against poison pills under Delaware law.
Flip-over Poison Pill Plan
The most popular type of poison pill anti-takeover defense. Shareholders of the target firm are issued
rights  to  purchase  common  stock  at  an  exercise  price  high  above  the  current  market  price.  If  a

Free-rider Paradox
Sometimes  benefits  and  costs  cannot  be  allocated  accurately  or  at  all  to  users  by  the  markets  or
otherwise. A free rider tries to take advantage of this situation. The paradox is that if everyone tries to
free  ride  no  one  can  and  everyone  is  worse  off.  An  important  example  is  the  natural  environment.
Most industrial users of the natural environment are free riders. Everyone collectively is worse off but
no  one  individually  finds  it  worthwhile  to  stop.  In  takeovers,  an  important  recent  example  is  the  basic
research  part  of  corporate  research  and  development.  It  is  impossible  to  limit  the  benefits  from  basic
research to the corporation who pays the bill. Therefore, there will be a strong temptation for companies
to free ride. Competition in the product and takeover market should increase this temptation.
