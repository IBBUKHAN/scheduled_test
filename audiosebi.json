The risk offsetting position(s) do not insulate the investor from certain event risks\n(such as termination of a merger agreement on the risk of completion of a transaction within a\ncertain time) so that the arbitrage is incomplete. (5) Tax arbitrage transactions are undertaken to share the benefit of differential tax rates or\ncircumstances of two or more parties to a transaction. (6) Regulatory arbitrage transactions are designed to provide indirect access to a risk management\nmarket where one party is denied direct access by law or regulation. (7) Swap driven arbitrage transactions are motivated by the comparative advantages which swap\ncounter-parties enjoy in different debt and currency markets. One counterparty may borrow at a\nrelatively lower rate in the intermediate or long term United States dollar market, while the other\nmay have a comparative advantage in floating rate sterling."

Usually it becomes effective when (i) there is an interested shareholder and (ii) the company engages in certain transactions with the interested shareholder or an affiliate, such as a merger or a sale of all or a large part of its assets. Historically, the flip-over poison pill was devised several years before the more powerful flip-in. At that time the essential discrimination against the interested shareholder that the flip-in entails was widely considered illegal. Now the two are generally combined, although under most circumstances the flip-in provision of the pill dominates any potential bidder’s attention."

The interested shareholder’s rights are void. Other shareholders can (typically) use each of their rights to buy a number of shares equal to two times the exercise price (set in advance), divided by the current market price of the target company’s stock. Usually, from the standpoint of a bidder, the flip-in right is a complete show stopper unless the bidder can convince a court that it should intervene. In the text we have tried to describe when courts intervene against poison pills under Delaware law."
