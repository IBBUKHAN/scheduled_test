    "Answer": "ETFs are mutual fund units that investors can buy or sell at the stock exchange. This is in contrast to a normal mutual fund unit that an investor buys or sells from the mutual fund (directly or through a distributor). In the ETF structure, the mutual fund does not deal directly with investors or distributors. Units are issued to a few designated large participants called Authorised Participants (APs). The APs provide buy and sell quotes for the ETFs on the stock exchange, which enable investors to buy and sell the ETFs at any given point of time when the stock markets are open for trading. ETFs therefore trade like stocks and experience price changes throughout the day as they are bought and sold. Buying and selling ETFs requires the investor to have demat and trading account."

    "Answer": "Generally, the personal savings of the entrepreneur along with contributions from friends and relatives are pooled in to start new business ventures or to expand existing ones. However, this may not be feasible in the case of capital intensive or large projects as the entrepreneur (promoter) may not be able to bring in his share of contribution (equity), which may be sizable, even after availing term loan from Financial Institutions/Banks. Thus availability of capital is a major constraint for the setting up or expanding ventures on a large scale. Instead of depending upon a limited pool of savings of a small circle of friends and relatives, the promoter has the option of raising money from the public across the country/world by issuing) shares of the company. For this purpose, the promoter can invite investment to his or her venture by issuing offer document which gives full details about track record, the company, the nature of the project, the business model, etc. If the investor is comfortable with this proposed venture, he may invest and thus become a shareholder of the company. Through aggregation, even small amounts available with a very large number of individuals translate into usable capital for corporates. Primary market is a market wherein corporates issue new securities for raising funds generally for long term capital requirement."

At times the issuer may revise the price band (revision of price band) which has to be accompanied with news paper advertisement. Bids by various investors are entered into the stock exchange system through the broker’s (also called syndicate member) terminal. The list of the bid received from investors at various price bands is known as the ‘book’ and can be seen in the website(s) of the stock exchange for each investor category. Based on the total demand in the ‘book’, the cut off price is then decided by the issuer and merchant banker. The cut off price is the price at which the cumulative demand for shares, equals or exceeds the offer size. All investors who applied (bid) for shares at or above the cut off price will be allotted shares at the cut off price (issue price), proportionately. If the investment is less than ` 200,000 (retail investor), the investor have the  option of bidding at the cut off price by ticking the cut-off option in the application form."

    "Answer": "Credit rating is an opinion of a Credit Rating Agency (CRA) on the likelihood of timely payment of interest and principal (credit risk) on the rated debt instrument. It is an unbiased, objective, and independent assessment of the issuer's capacity to meet its financial obligations and is conveyed with alphanumeric symbols. Credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold a debt instrument. It is a comment on the probability of the interest and principal of a debt instrument being paid or not paid on time (credit risk). Rating is an additional input; however investors are required to make your their independent and objective analysis before arriving at an investment decision."
  },
  {
    "Answer": "Each credit rating agency has its own set of criteria and different weight age for each component for assigning the ratings. The indicative list of factors that are taken into consideration for credit rating are issuer company’s operational efficiency, its strengths and weakness, level of technological development, financials, competence and effectiveness of management, past record of debt servicing, etc. The issuer pays for the credit rating."
  },
  {
    "Answer": "Each rating symbol is an alphanumeric representation of the degree of repayment risk associated with debt instruments. Depending on the type of debt instrument that is rated (long term, short term or  fixed deposits), rating symbols vary. The debt instruments rated 'BBB' and above are classified as investment grade ratings. An investment grade rating signifies the rating agency’s belief that the rated instrument is likely to meet its payment obligations. Instruments that are rated ‘BB‘ and below are classified as speculative grade category ratings in which case the ability to meet the payment obligations is considered to be “speculative”. Instruments rated in the speculative grade are considered to carry materially higher risk and a higher probability of default compared to instruments rated in the investment grade. Within a rating category, “+” and “-” symbols are used to indicate finer distinctions. Illustratively, ratings in a higher rating category such as ‘AA-‘ is stronger than ratings in a lower rating category such as ‘A+‘."

  },
  {
    "Answer": "Rating is an opinion based on information available at a point in time with the CRA. However, information can change significantly over time causing the issuer company’s performance to deviate from the earlier expectations thereby affecting the future repayment abilities and thus, requiring the rating to be altered. CRA are required to continuously monitor the rating of debt instrument till its maturity and carry out periodic reviews of all published ratings. In case of any changes in the ratings so assigned, the agencies are required to disclose the same through press releases and on their respective websites. A downgrade in the rating indicates that the risk of the instrument is higher than what was earlier predicted."
  },
  {
    "Answer": "A credit rating is a professional opinion given after studying all available information at a particular point of time. Nevertheless, such opinions may prove wrong in the context of subsequent events. There is no contract between an investor and a rating agency and the investor is free to accept or reject the opinion of the agency. - 24 - It is advisable that the investor should also do his own risk analysis apart from relying on ratings while making investments."
